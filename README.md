# Introduction

A program to generate page wise Anki flashcards for the Qurʾān.

It is available on HuggingFace as [hifzize](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rehandaphedar/hifzize).

Due to deck size restrictions, it is not available on AnkiWeb yet.

# Installation

```sh
go install git.sr.ht/~rehandaphedar/hifzize@latest
```

The package helps interact with the [Quranic Universal Library (QUL)](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-metadata).

# Usage

The documentation for usage and flags can be accessed by running `hifzize -h`.

- The `-words` data can be obtained from QUL's [Ayah by ayah and word by text of Quran](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script)
- The `-layout` data can be obtained from QUL's [Mushaf Layout Resources](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/mushaf-layout)
- The `-metadata-*` can be obtained from QUL's [Quran data, surahs, ayahs, words, juz etc.](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-metadata)

The page images for the default deck are extracted using `pdfimages` from [the KFGQPC website](https://qurancomplex.gov.sa/), specifically the 640 pages version of Al-Muṣḥaf Al-Wasaṭ of the Ḥafṣ Qirāʿah. The reasons for this choice are:

- Ḥafṣ is the most popular Qirāʿah.
- Al-Muṣḥaf Al-Wasaṭ has a consistent "bounding box"/width for each page, which means that the page text is automatically aligned to the appropriate side. This is in contrast to Al-Muṣḥaf Al-ʿĀdī for example, in which the width of the page changes if there are juz/ḥizb markers on the side.

You are free to use another Muṣḥaf and/or Qirāʿah to generate your own deck.

# Note Type

The hifzize note type produces the Page Recall card type.
The front of the card shows few lines of the previous page, while the back of the card shows the last few lines of the previous page, the full current page, and the first few lines of the next page.

# Recommended Usage

It is recommended to suspend all notes at first and unsuspend by tag as you memorise.

It is also recommended to use the [mayyize](https://sr.ht/~rehandaphedar/mayyize) deck alongside this deck, unsuspending by page tag in the mayyize deck as you memorise. Note that the default tag format of both the decks is the same to facilitate this.
